## Supply network management
You (a manufacturer e.g. Plastic homeware manufacturer) <- First tier supplier (e.g. supplying you with packaging) <- Second tier supplier (e.g. supplying the first tier supplier with materials need to make the packaging.) <- Etc.

You -> First tier customer (e.g. Wholesaler) -> Second tier customer (e.g. retailer)

### Operations network for a shopping mall
#### First tier suppliers:
- Security services
- Cleaning services
- Maintenance services

#### Second tier suppliers:
- Recruitment agency
- Cleaning materials supplier

#### First tier Customers
- Retailers

#### Second tier customers:
- Retail customers

Extent (Narrow process span) - How much you include in your operation, e.g. are you a retailer and an assembly operation?

Balance - Who do you supply? E.g. Do you only supply your own company or other companies aswell?

### Vertical integration
#### Advantages
- You get what you need for production.
- Can reduce costs, e.g. by setting your own market price.
- Can improve the product.
- Helps understanding other activities in the supply network

#### Disadvantages
- Creates an internal monopoly, "You become fat and lazy after a while...". You have to use your own products.
- If you don't sell to your competitors you can't exploit economies of scale.
- Loss of flexibility
- Cuts you of from innovation
- Distracts you from core activities. (Not MVP.)

### Location

We want a cheap location which is near to our customers.

### Traditional market based strategy
#### Advantages
- Competition -> Other businesses compete e.g. by lowering their prices.
- You don't have to know what's coming next, you only have to buy the best.

#### Disadvantage
- Someone might not sell to you, because they have an agreement with someone else.

Close relationship - You work together to find new solutions, and you work for a long time together.

"Partnership supply management" - Do everything important + a few close suppliers.

## Supply chain management of services

You can have a service done:
Home/abroad and Inhouse/Supplied.

Inhouse/Home - Traditional
Supplied/Home - Outsourced

Inhouse/Abroad - Offshored (can be a shared service center (SSC), selling the service to others)
Supplied/Abroad - Outsourced + Offshored, (growing rapidly)

### Offshoring
- Run by large companies with global presence

Tasks that's commonly being outsourced - Jobs that can't be automated, but doesn't need much "knowledge" to perform ("labor not engineering"). E.g. programming, book-keeping, call-centers, etc.

We often outsource activities that are "alien" to our core business, e.g. a vacuum manufacturer should make vacuums not answer phone calls from customers.

### Outsourcing
#### Advantages
- It often costs less. Most important, a cost driven decision.
- You want to focus on what you do best. E.g. building vacuums.
- We might not have the knowledge to do it, e.g. programming an app.
- You can have a higher quality service. E.g. you might not be able to have service 24/7, but with a call center you can. (as you share with others)
- Access to latest technology.

#### Risks
- Transfer costs much
- It's not easy to make sure that the supplier knows what you want.
- Often you remove too much/less from your own organization when you outsource. Because you thought you knew which part of your organisation you outsourced.
- It makes the communication harder.
